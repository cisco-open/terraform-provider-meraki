# meraki_devices_appliance_radio_settings (Resource)

~>Warning: This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Meraki Dashboard, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect. Instead, it is a task part of a Meraki Dashboard workflow. It is executed in Meraki without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action 
already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_devices_appliance_radio_settings" "example" {

  five_ghz_settings = {

    channel       = 149
    channel_width = 20
    target_power  = 15
  }
  rf_profile_id = "1234"
  serial        = "string"
  two_four_ghz_settings = {

    channel      = 11
    target_power = 21
  }
}

output "meraki_devices_appliance_radio_settings_example" {
  value = meraki_devices_appliance_radio_settings.example
}
