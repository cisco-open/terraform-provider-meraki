~>Warning: This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Meraki Dashboard, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect. Instead, it is a task part of a Meraki Dashboard workflow. It is executed in Meraki without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action 
already existed previously.

## Example Usage

resource "meraki_organizations_inventory_claim" "example" {

  organization_id = "string"
  parameters = {

    licenses = [{

    }]
    orders  = ["4CXXXXXXX"]
    serials = ["Q234-ABCD-5678"]
  }
