# meraki_organizations_integrations_xdr_networks_disable (Resource)





~>Warning: This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Meraki Dashboard, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect. Instead, it is a task part of a Meraki Dashboard workflow. It is executed in Meraki without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action 
already existed previously.


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_organizations_integrations_xdr_networks_disable" "example" {

  organization_id = "string"
  parameters = {

    networks = [{

      network_id    = "N_1234567"
      product_types = ["appliance"]
    }]
  }
}

output "meraki_organizations_integrations_xdr_networks_disable_example" {
  value = meraki_organizations_integrations_xdr_networks_disable.example
}
```
