# meraki_networks_sm_devices_shutdown (Resource)



~>Warning: This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Meraki Dashboard, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect. Instead, it is a task part of a Meraki Dashboard workflow. It is executed in Meraki without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action 
already existed previously.


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_networks_sm_devices_shutdown" "example" {

  network_id = "string"
  parameters = {

    ids       = ["1284392014819", "2983092129865"]
    scope     = ["withAny", "tag1", "tag2"]
    serials   = ["XY0XX0Y0X0", "A01B01CD00E", "X02YZ1ZYZX"]
    wifi_macs = ["00:11:22:33:44:55"]
