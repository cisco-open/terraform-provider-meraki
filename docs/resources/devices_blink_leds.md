# meraki_devices_blink_leds (Resource)



~>Warning: This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Meraki Dashboard, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect. Instead, it is a task part of a Meraki Dashboard workflow. It is executed in Meraki without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action 
already existed previously.


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_devices_blink_leds" "example" {

  serial = "string"
  parameters = {

    duration = 20
    duty     = 50
    period   = 160
  }
}

output "meraki_devices_blink_leds_example" {
  value = meraki_devices_blink_leds.example
}
```
