# meraki_networks_sm_devices_install_apps (Resource)

~>Warning: This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Meraki Dashboard, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect. Instead, it is a task part of a Meraki Dashboard workflow. It is executed in Meraki without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action 
already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_networks_sm_devices_install_apps" "example" {

  device_id  = "string"
  network_id = "string"
  parameters = {

    app_ids = ["1284392014819", "2983092129865"]
    force   = false
  }
}

output "meraki_networks_sm_devices_install_apps_example" {
  value = meraki_networks_sm_devices_install_apps.example
}
```
