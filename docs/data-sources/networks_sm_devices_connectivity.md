# meraki_networks_sm_devices_connectivity (Data Source)



## Example Usage

```terraform
data "meraki_networks_sm_devices_connectivity" "example" {

  device_id      = "string"
  ending_before  = "string"
  network_id     = "string"
  per_page       = 1
  starting_after = "string"
}

output "meraki_networks_sm_devices_connectivity_example" {
  value = data.meraki_networks_sm_devices_connectivity.example.items

## Schema

### Required

- `device_id` (String) deviceId path parameter. Device ID
- `network_id` (String) networkId path parameter. Network ID

### Optional

- `ending_before` (String) endingBefore query parameter. A token used by the server to indicate the end of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an ID but it is not limited to those. This parameter should not be defined by client applications. The link for the first, last, prev, or next page in the HTTP Link header should define it.

- `starting_after` (String) startingAfter query parameter. A token used by the server to indicate the start of the page. Often this is a timestamp or an ID but it is not limited to those. This parameter should not be defined by client applications. The link for the first, last, prev, or next page in the HTTP Link header should define it.

### Read-Only

- `items` (Attributes List) Array of ResponseSmGetNetworkSmDeviceConnectivity (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Read-Only:

- `first_seen_at` (String) When the device was first seen as connected to the internet in each connection.
