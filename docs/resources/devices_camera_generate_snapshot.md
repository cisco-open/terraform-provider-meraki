# meraki_devices_camera_generate_snapshot (Resource)



~>Warning: This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Meraki Dashboard, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect. Instead, it is a task part of a Meraki Dashboard workflow. It is executed in Meraki without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action 
already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_devices_camera_generate_snapshot" "example" {

  serial = "string"
  parameters = {

    fullframe = false
    timestamp = "2021-04-30T15:18:08Z"
  }
}

output "meraki_devices_camera_generate_snapshot_example" {
  value = meraki_devices_camera_generate_snapshot.example
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `parameters` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--parameters))
- `serial` (String) serial path parameter.

<a id="nestedatt--parameters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `parameters`

Optional:

- `fullframe` (Boolean) [optional] If set to "true" the snapshot will be taken at full sensor resolution. This will error if used with timestamp.
- `timestamp` (String) [optional] The snapshot will be taken from this time on the camera. The timestamp is expected to be in ISO 8601 format. If no timestamp is specified, we will assume current time.
