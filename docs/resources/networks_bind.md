# meraki_networks_bind (Resource)



~>Warning: This resource does not represent a real-world entity in Meraki Dashboard, therefore changing or deleting this resource on its own has no immediate effect. Instead, it is a task part of a Meraki Dashboard workflow. It is executed in Meraki without any additional verification. It does not check if it was executed before or if a similar configuration or action 
already existed previously.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "meraki_networks_bind" "example" {

  network_id = "string"
  parameters = {

    auto_bind          = false
    config_template_id = "N_23952905"
  }
}

output "meraki_networks_bind_example" {
  value = meraki_networks_bind.example
}
```

### Nested Schema for `parameters`

Optional:

- `auto_bind` (Boolean) Optional boolean indicating whether the network's switches should automatically bind to profiles of the same model. Defaults to false if left unspecified. This option only affects switch networks and switch templates. Auto-bind is not valid unless the switch template has at least one profile and has at most one profile per switch model.
- `config_template_id` (String) The ID of the template to which the network should be bound.
